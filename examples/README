Examples directory:


1)  For the most basic clustering (with fixed K):

        cluster_and_visualize.pl


2)  For clustering with an unknown value for K:

       find_best_K_and_cluster.pl


3)  If your datafile is too large, you may need to 
    range limit the values of K that are searched through

       find_best_K_in_range_and_cluster.pl


4)  If you also want to include data normalization (it
    may reduce the performance of the clusterer in some
    cases):

       cluster_after_data_normalization.pl


5)  When you include the data normalization step and
    you would like to visualize the data before and
    after normalization:

       cluster_and_visualize_with_data_visualization.pl*

Support scripts:


6)  For generating the data for experiments with clustering

       data_generator.pl


7)  For cleaning up the examples directory

       cleanup_directory.pl
